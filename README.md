Link to app on App Store: [KnightNews](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knightnews/id912539758?mt=8 "KnightNews").

## Building

KnightNews for iOS uses CocoaPods to manage third party party libraries, trying to build the project by itself (KnightNews.xcproj) will result in an error, because the CocoaPods will not be included. Instead, launch the workspace by either double clicking on the KnightNews.xcworkspace file, or by launching Xcode and choosing File > Open and browse to KnightNews.xcworkspace.
