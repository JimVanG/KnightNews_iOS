KnightNews_iOS
==============

A news reader for Knight News on iOS.

Link to app on App Store: [KnightNews](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knightnews/id912539758?mt=8 "KnightNews").

## Building

KnightNews for iOS uses CocoaPods to manage third party party libraries, trying to build the project by itself (`KnightNews.xcproj`) will result in an error, because the CocoaPods will not be included. Instead, launch the workspace by either double clicking on the `KnightNews.xcworkspace` file, or by launching Xcode and choosing File > Open and browse to `KnightNews.xcworkspace`.
